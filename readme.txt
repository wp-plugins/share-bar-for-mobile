Mobile Share by errnio provides a simple and slick share bar for your mobile website.

== Description ==

The errnio **Mobile Share** plugin for Wordpress enhances mobile sharing with added features for your mobile site, providing added tools to share to facebook, twitter, whatsapp, and email. The bar design dynamically adjusts, according to the operating system and browser in use by the site visitor, offering a natural and native design on iOS or Android.

= Features =
Our main features include the following items:

* **Share** - a bottom bar with share options to Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, and Mail. The bar appears on the first scroll event on the page, and remains at the bottom of the screen.
* **Customization** - Add additional site features using errnio’s control panel. Register with us to discover more.


Along with the share bar, the errnio plugin can also add a new revenue and engagement layer to your site. Without adding **ads** or **banners**, errnio can enhance your revenue. Make **more** money from your site with **no more** banners or ads. Register and contact us to find out more.


= How it Works =

The **errnio plugin** reaches out to errnio servers and includes the errnio **gesture recognition code**. The gesture recognition code presents the site search box when a user scrolls down your site, offering an intuitive mobile friendly search experience.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is errnio? =
errnio is a unique new solution to engage and monetize your mobile website visitors through the way they naturally engage with a mobile screen - finger gestures. By integrating our code into your site, you can create native engagement points with your users, which blend seamlessly into mobile user experience. Our solution generates higher mobile engagement, better visit metrics to your site, and an additional, friendly, non-intrusive monetization stream.
= What does errnio do / how does errnio work? =
Our code detects delicate finger gestures and multi touch events on the mobile device screen, and reacts with the relevant product to help you promote content and search offers on your site.
= How does errnio make money? =
errnio uses specific, user initiated events, to promote content, search suggestions, targeted offers and recommended apps during interactions with our gesture products. We never display banners or take up your page real-estate. Our products only interact with gesture performed by the users, and monetize during user selections.
= How does the errnio revenue program it work? =
errnio shares revenue with selected publishers on the basis of actions performed within it’s gesture products, creating an additional revenue stream for the site. To be eligible for this program, please apply by sending us an email to info@errnio.com with your site details such as mobile traffic volumes and country breakdown.
= Where can I see my revenue? =
At the moment, we only show revenue date to our program partners (for more, see our answer regarding how our revenue program works). Revenue partners can gain access to our reporting via CSV reports sent directly to their email address on a periodical basis.
= How can I apply to the revenue program? =
To be eligible for this program, please apply by sending us an email to info@errnio.com with your site details such as mobile traffic volumes and country breakdown. Please note publishers are approved on a discretionary basis, according to volume and quality of traffic.
= How do I integrate errnio into my site? =
Integrating errnio is very simple, by installing a simple extension on your site management platform, or pasting a simple line of code into your site HTML. For details, please follow instructions set forward in your control panel under “grab your code”. By selecting your platform of choice we present we deliver the correct integration procedure. At the moment, we offer full platform support to Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal publishers. However, for any other platform we offer a simple HTML snippet which can be integrated within almost any site or platform. If for any reason your platform is not supported, please feel free to send us a direct support request at info@errnio.com.
= I’m not seeing errnio after integration, why? =
Well, first of all, errnio does not display itself on your site directly, but rather is only made visible when users perform gesture on your mobile site. For example, when using our scroll products, our search box feature is only shown when scrolling down. For a demonstration of our products please see the “gestures” section of your control panel.
To make sure you are testing our products within a supported device, browser and operating system, on mobile (we do not operate on desktop). For more information please see our supported environments answer in this FAQ.

Currently, errnio supports the following environments:
* Operating systems: Android and iOS
* Browsers: Safari (iOS), Chrome (iOS and Android), Native Browser (Android). We also support other browser platforms passively (they are not actively supported, but we do not block errnio from operating on them), these include Facebook App internal browser on iOS and Android, and in some cases Opera, Dolphin and Mozilla browser.

No. We’ve designed our code to load quick and to load last, so that it will never interrupt your site’s performance.
